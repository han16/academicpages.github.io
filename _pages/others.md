## download data from dbGaP and annotate 


<span style="font-size:0.7em;">
[dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/) is short for database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. Before one download a data set, PI needs to apply for it and it may take a couple of weeks to get approved.</span>  
  
 <span style="font-size:0.7em;">
 step 1: login to PI's [eRA Commons account](https://public.era.nih.gov/commons/public/login.do?TARGET=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.era.nih.gov%2Fcommons%2FcommonsInit.do) to access the data <br>
 step 2: once you find the requested data, click download. There are several options, you may choose download to the local machine (make sure you have enough space) or HPC cluster which is preferred because the raw data even zipped is pretty big, (could be ~100G). It may take some time for download, especially when the data is very large, thus they would recommand installing [Aspera Connect](https://www.ibm.com/aspera/downloads/?p1=Search&p4=43700050328291508&p5=b&cm_mmc=Search_Google-_-1S_1S-_-WW_NA-_-%2Baspera_b&cm_mmca7=71700000060940834&cm_mmca8=kwd-297893703589&cm_mmca9=EAIaIQobChMIsJXmh5Ct6gIVTr7ACh0JHQ_-EAAYASABEgIQF_D_BwE&cm_mmca10=406108702306&cm_mmca11=b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsJXmh5Ct6gIVTr7ACh0JHQ_-EAAYASABEgIQF_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for high speed download.<br>
 step 3: <b>all data are encrypted </b> for the sake of privacy.
